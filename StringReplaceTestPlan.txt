TEST PLAN FOR STRING REPLACEMENT
================================

@author: nfalor

Problem: Given a String and a Character, remove all instances of the Character in the String
	
Solutions:
	- Iterate through the String, one character at a time
	- Find a method in the String class that can solve this in one line
	
Java class to store separate methods for each solution
	
TestNG class to store each solution which tests these methods
Use DataProvider for storing the test data which include both positive and negative cases for verifications

Positive Test Case:

Input String: "hello world"
Character to remove: 'o'
Expected Output: "hell wrld"

Negative Test Case:

Input String: null
Character to remove: 'o'
Expected Output: null

TOOLS:

Coding Language - Java
Unit Test Framework - TestNG
Repository - GitHub
Build automation tool - Maven
Run the TestNG test suite and generate test reports - TestNG SureFire
IDE for developing the Framework - Eclipse
